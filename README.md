Product Affinity analysis on the public dataset - 'Grocery'

Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items. For example, if you are in an English pub and you buy a pint of beer and don't buy a bar meal, you are more likely to buy crisps (US).

The 'Apriori' algorithm is very well suited for this purpose. It uses two measures to identify significant patterns in the data:

1)Support: How frequently a pattern occurs in the data (how frequently a certain set of items are purchased?)
2)Confidence: It measures the predictive power of the pattern (How strong the pattern is)

In this repository, I have carried out a very basic version of market basket analysis.
